### Description
For this challenge, I created a professional portfolio using HTML and CSS. This site is a resource both for myself and potential employers, as it allows an opportunity to showcase my work and a few things about myself. The page contains links to my portfolio projects, primarily placeholder images for the moment, as well as my Github and a way to contact me.
